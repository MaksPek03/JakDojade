ðŸš— JakDojade - Route Planning Algorithm ðŸš‰
This project is a University project for an Algorithm Course, focused on developing an efficient route planning algorithm for public transport systems. The algorithm helps users find the best route to their destination based on various factors.

ðŸš€ Features:
Route Calculation: Computes the optimal public transport route from the starting point to the destination.
Algorithm Design: Implements a well-known algorithm for route optimization.
C++ Implementation: Built entirely in C++ for fast computation.

ðŸ“¦ Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/MaksPek03/JakDojade.git
cd JakDojade

Build the project:

Use a C++ compiler to build the project.

g++ jak_dojade.cpp -o jak_dojade

Run the program:

Execute the compiled program to find your optimal route:

./jak_dojade
